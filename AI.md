| Copilot | Shorten parseTentativeCommand() and maintain SLAP for Parser.java | When given specific instructions (i.e. to act on a single method), Copilot tends to focus on those specific instructions without understanding the context. For example, it made a new method findSlotsIndex() to find delimiter "/slots" instead of creating a general method findIndex() / using existing methods to find delimiters by passing in a string parameter. |
